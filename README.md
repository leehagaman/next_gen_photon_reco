Some tests for a second shower veto using WC 3D cosmic spacepoints. We compress the cosmic information number to a smaller number of spacepoints for efficiency. Could be useful for single photon searches in MicroBooNE and other LArTPCs. 

Similar idea to the second shower veto analyzing hits on 2D projected views used in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 111801 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.111801).
